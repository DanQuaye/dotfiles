Dotfiles
========================

This repo contains all of my important dotfiles so far

Any files with the .symlink extension will be automatically symlinked into my home directory by the install script.
Vim plugins are added as submodules in the vim.symlink/bundle folder with Pathogen handling the details of loading them then.

## Setup

    Clone this repo to wherever you want to keep it
    Run install.py
